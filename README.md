# Welcome to A InstAd

InstAd is a decentralized digital advertising platform that utilizes blockchain technology to bring trust, transparency, and fairness to the digital advertising industry. The platform connects advertisers who want to place ads on websites with website owners who are willing to display those ads.

## Feature 

1. Targeted Advertising 
Allow users to choose specific websites based on their target audience, interests, and demographics. This way, they can ensure that their ad is seen by the right people, increasing the chances of engagement and conversion.

2. Smart Contract
Use smart contracts to automate the payment process and ensure that both parties are satisfied with the transaction. For example, if an advertiser pays for five days of advertising but the website owner does not display the ad, the payment will be automatically refunded to the advertiser.

3. Crypto Payment
The Publisher must pay 0.001 SHM in this case for five days before their advertisement appears on the company's website.
